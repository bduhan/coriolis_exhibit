# coriolis_exhibit
TTU Museum exhibit on "How Weather Works"

This exhibit illustrates [Coriolis Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force) with:

 * a synchronized camera and rotating table
 * viewer drops balls in a chute and observes the deflection pattern
 * observation on a TV screen

This is a work in progress, presently we are decoding how the partially finished exhibit was wired, fixing the motor drive issues, and working towards synchronizing the two different stepper motors.
